- 1. Summary

 * Finished
  * First, I identified the attributes data is comprised of
  * Then, I partitioned these attributes into sets of characteristics
  * I used the attributes and characteristics to choose a set of dates to test
   * I chose -1, 0, 1, and a value too high for each month and date, as well as 1899 and 2201 for year
   * I arbitrarily used 2015 and 2016 form my standard leap and non leap years
   * I tested the end of month days for both months with 31 days, 30 days, and Feb in both leap and non leap years
   * I tested the last day of the year
   * I tested 2000 as the exception leap year
   * I also tested 1900 and 2200 as boundary valid years
  * I implemented my DateCheck class that is an extension of ColumnFixture
  * I used FitNesse to implement and test the test cases I specified earlier
 * Outstanding
  * I was still having problems with my coverage report showing me 0%.

- 2. Lessons Learned

 * There is a lot of ways to partition out Date, and it can get pretty complex when choosing cases that cover everything but aren't redundant
 * These tests actually helped reveal a few faults in my code, mostly due to me not handling error values such as -1 or 0
 * After setup, FitNesse was a surprisingly easy to use tool, this exercise would have been much more work using something like JUnit
 * You have to be careful when you specify the expected output for your tests, as sometimes I entered the wrong thing, which could have made false positives
 * However, some parts of FitNesse is less expressive compared to JUnit, and it seems that it would be harder to test more complex functionalities

- 3. Suggestions for Improvements (Optional)

 * I was a little confused when writing my classes on how I should have handled exceptions, and I needed to spend time going back during lab to patch it up, so extra instructions would have been appreciated.
